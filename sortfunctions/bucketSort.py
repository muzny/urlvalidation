    Class that defines our bucket sort algorithm. Although bucket sort
    can do as poorly as O(n^2) in worst case, it can do as well as
    O(n) in best case (i.e. the case when each element hashes into
    its own bucket). So on average, it isn't O(n), but then again
    no sorting algorithm is, and we chose to pick a sorting
    algorithm with a good best-case.
